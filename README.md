Hey there!

This little spot is where I've put my solutions for the Week 1 Code Challenge. It's all about practicing JavaScript with a few fun little programs:

A calculator for making Kenyan chai.
An estimator for Boda Boda (motorbike taxi) fares.
A simple tool to estimate mobile money transaction fees.
How to Play Around With It
Get the files: Download or clone this repository to your computer.
Open index.html: Just open the index.html file in your web browser.
Check your console: Press F12 (or right-click and "Inspect" -> "Console") to open your browser's developer console. You'll see instructions there on how to choose which challenge to run.
That's it! Hope you find it useful.
